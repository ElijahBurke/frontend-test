## causaLens Challenge

Hey Guys,
Thank's for the opportunity to have a go at this. It was a lot of fun. Overall I'm somewhat dissapointed with the final product. Unfortunately I ran out of time before finishing the predictions result dashboard. I lost some time at the beginning because I was planning to use TypeScript, but ran into trouble with the Create React App with TypeScript Defaults, and figured it would waste too much time setting up my own config so opted to go without.

## Getting Started
```
cd server
npm i && npm run server
cd ../client
npm i && npm start
```
